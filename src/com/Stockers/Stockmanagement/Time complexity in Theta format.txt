Time complexity in theta format 
No--> is the throshold peak
scenario 1: Display the companies stock prices in ascending order
21<=11n<=11n+1
No >= 1
which is O(nlogn) time complexity for best, worst and Average case

Scenario 2: Display the companies stock prices in descending order
21<=11n<=11n+1
No >= 1
which is O(nlogn) time complexity for best, worst and Average case

Scenario 3:Display the total no of companies for which stock prices rose today
Time complexity in theta form is  NA

Scenario 4:Display the total no of companies for which stock prices declinetoday
Time complexity in theta form is  NA

Scenario5: Search a specific stock price
22<=4n+18<=4n+22
No >= 2
which is O(nlogn) in worst case and Average case and O(1) in Best case.
